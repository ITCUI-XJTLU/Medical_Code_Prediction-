was not associated with exertion as he has been pretty sedentary at home because of his condition.He has no energy and is unable to do much over the last few months.At his PCPs office he was feeling unwell with constant non radiating chest pain that was centrally located and persistent.He had not taken any medications at the time of the appointment.Dr.First.Name STitle checked an EKG that showed a rate of that was interpreted as sinus tachycardia with no signs of ischemia.He was given a nitroglycerin tab which resolved his chest pain as well as a chewable aspirin.He was supposed to get 25mg of lopressor in the office but.Dr.First.Name STitle was unsure if he got it prior to transfer.On transfer to the ED EMS was concerned for STEMI with ST elevations in lead.V4 on transport however the initial EKG in the ED showed tachycardia with ST depressions in.V6.Initial vitals were HR BP RR SaO2 RA.T.His rate was in the 130s and EKGs showed possible a flutter.He had persistent chest pain with nausea and vomiting in the ED.He was given tab of nitro and lopressor 5mg IV x2.His SBP dropped to the s and he became unresponsive and pulseless in PEA arrest CPR was initiated he recieved mg of epinephrine 1mg of atropine of bicarb and then a bicarb drip was started.He was coded for minutes.He was intubated and placed on dopamine and levophed drips and transferred to the CCU.Vitals post arrest on transfer were HR BP.O2.Sat TV PEEP RR and.Fi02.His lactate was elevated to prior to the code so the ED ordered a head CT which was negative and a CT torso to look for possible infection.He was started on vanc levo cefepime in the ED.In the ED labs showed an metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate.Labs were also notable for a HCT drop a supratherapeutic INR and end organ ischemia with elevated transaminases and elevated creatinine.On the floor he was intubated and sedated on dopamine and levophed drips.A triple lumen RIJ was placed at the bedside.He was started on dobutamine
